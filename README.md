# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project
Steve is looking to analyze the stock market over the last couple of years for his parents.
  
### Purpose
The purpose of my analysis was to visually show which stocks would be the best option for Steve's parents by comparing the stocks for the last couple of years.  Having all the data in a spreadsheet allows Steve to quickly compare which stocks would be the best option for Steve's parents.
  
## Election-Audit Results
Steve asked to compare stocks for his parents over multiple years. I was able to create a program to compare stocks for whichever year Steve would like to see the stock results. 

### Analysis of 2018 Stocks
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

## Election-Audit Summary
- What are the advantages of refactoring code?
1. Quicker result feed back time.
2. Can analyze a larger database. 
3. Not reinventing the wheel, using previous code for larger datasets 

- What are the disadvantages of refactoring code?
1. Understanding which code needs to be refactored.
2. Ensuring all code is complete and in the right section.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
1. I was able to analyze multiple years of stocks is a faster manner. The multiple years contained more datasets which the refactored code allowed me to analyze quickly. 
2. I initially had a single line of code in the wrong section, which led to a run time error and alot of debugging until I figured out the answer.
3. There was new code that I didn't completely understand, I had to research code to ensure I was using it correctly, which took time.
