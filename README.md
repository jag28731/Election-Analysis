# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project
Tom and Seth are looking to do an election audit.
  
### Purpose
The purpose of my analysis was to conduct an election audit and visually show which candidate won the election and which county had the largest turnout. Each candidate and county will be broken down by how many votes they had and the percentage of votes. The winning candidate will be displayed and show their total votes and the percentage of votes they received. 
  
## Election-Audit Results
Seth and Tom asked me to do an election audit to show the winner. I was able to create a program to calculate the results of the election and display the winner, largest county turnout and break down the candidates and county votes and percentages. 

### Analysis of 2018 Stocks
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
  There was a total of 369,711 votes casted in the election.
  
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
  There were three counties where votes were cast. The counties were Arapahoe, Denver, and Jefferson. The counties votes were broken down as follows:
    Arapahoe - 24,801 votes, 23% of the total votes.
    Denver - 272,892 votes, 82.8% of the total votes.
    Jefferson - 38,855 votes, 10.5% of the total votes. 
    
- Which county had the largest number of votes?
  Denver had the most votes with 82.8% of the total votes. 
  
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
  There were three candidates that were voted for in this election. The cadidates were Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, Raymon Anthony Doane. The candidates voted for       were broken down as follows:
  Charles Casper Stockham - 85,213 votes, 23% of the total votes.
  Diana DeGette - 272,892 votes, 73.8% of the total votes. 
  Raymon Anthony Doane - 11,606, 3.1% of the total votes. 
  
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

## Election-Audit Summary
- What are the advantages of refactoring code?
1. Quicker result feed back time.
2. Can analyze a larger database. 
3. Not reinventing the wheel, using previous code for larger datasets 

- What are the disadvantages of refactoring code?
1. Understanding which code needs to be refactored.
2. Ensuring all code is complete and in the right section.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
1. I was able to analyze multiple years of stocks is a faster manner. The multiple years contained more datasets which the refactored code allowed me to analyze quickly. 
2. I initially had a single line of code in the wrong section, which led to a run time error and alot of debugging until I figured out the answer.
3. There was new code that I didn't completely understand, I had to research code to ensure I was using it correctly, which took time.
