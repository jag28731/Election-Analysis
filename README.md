# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project
Tom and Seth are looking to do an election audit.
  
### Purpose
The purpose of my analysis was to conduct an election audit and visually show which candidate won the election and which county had the largest turnout. Each candidate and county will be broken down by how many votes they had and the percentage of votes. The winning candidate will be displayed and show their total votes and the percentage of votes they received. 
  
## Election-Audit Results
Seth and Tom asked me to do an election audit to show the winner. I was able to create a program to calculate the results of the election and display the winner, largest county turnout and break down the candidates and county votes and percentages. 

### Analysis of 2018 Stocks
- How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

  There was a total of 369,711 votes casted in the election.
  
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

  There were three counties where votes were cast. The counties were Arapahoe, Denver, and Jefferson. The counties votes were broken down as follows:
    Arapahoe - 24,801 votes, 23% of the total votes.
    Denver - 272,892 votes, 82.8% of the total votes.
    Jefferson - 38,855 votes, 10.5% of the total votes. 
    
- Which county had the largest number of votes?

  Denver had the most votes with 82.8% of the total votes. 
  
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

  There were three candidates that were voted for in this election. The cadidates were Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, Raymon Anthony Doane. The candidates voted for       were broken down as follows:
  Charles Casper Stockham - 85,213 votes, 23% of the total votes.
  Diana DeGette - 272,892 votes, 73.8% of the total votes. 
  Raymon Anthony Doane - 11,606, 3.1% of the total votes. 
  
- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

  Diana DeGette won the election with a total of 272,892 votes, 73.8% of the total votes.

## Election-Audit Summary

The script that was written for this election was a quick process to visually see who won the election audit. The script can be used for other elections with a quick modification of the candidates and counties to visually show the results of any election. All the county has to do is create a spreadsheet with the new election stats and then run the script to quickly determine who won the election.

One way this script could be modified to use in another election is if there is a vote on a new law. Instead of using candidates and county, the new script could contain a pass or not pass code. This will allow all the votes for the new law to be displayed on whether the new law will be passed or not. 

Another way is if a county or state is trying to decide what kind of building should be built in an empty lot. The new script could be written to display which building the residents voted on to build.
